Stack Overflowers,Shagil Islam,Shadan Akhtar,Yousuf Minhaj Khan,Mnemosyne - The AI Memory Prosthetic,"Instead of a simple reminder app, Mnemosyne is an ""Always-On"" Multi-Agent System that runs on an early-stage Alzheimer’s/Dementia patients' phone (or wearable) and passively ""listens"" to conversations and ""sees"" the environment (via camera/audio) to provide real-time context cues to the patient before they get confused.","We've added a detailed description about the entire project in this public README: https://github.com/shagil77/mnemosyne

Mnemosyne: The Gemini 3 Memory Prosthetic 🧠✨

A real-time ""Cognitive Prosthetic"" that leverages Gemini 3's 2M+ context window to restore dignity and social connection for dementia patients.

---

The Mission (Problem & Impact): Dementia doesn't just steal memories; it steals the confidence to interact with the world. Patients often face the ""Stranger in the Mirror"" problem—failing to recognize loved ones, which leads to social withdrawal and rapid cognitive decline. Mnemosyne acts as an invisible, empathetic friend that whispers vital context (names, shared memories, and emotional cues) into a patient’s earpiece in real-time, allowing them to navigate life with independence and dignity.

---

Technical Architecture: Mnemosyne uses a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System designed to process a live multimodal stream with extreme efficiency.

1. Perception Agent (Gemini 3 Flash)

* Role: Handles the high-frequency multimodal ""Passive Listening"" phase.

* Capability: Processes sub-second video/audio frames to detect faces, voices, and environmental ""vibes."" It outputs structured JSON only when ""High-Signal"" entities (like a person entering the room) are detected.

2. Context Agent (Gemini 3 Pro)
* Role: The ""Active Reasoning"" brain.

* Gemini Advantage: Utilizes the 2M+ context window to maintain a ""Living Knowledge Graph"" of the patient’s entire life history.
* Frugal Relevance Filter: We engineered a custom filter that reduces token usage by intelligently deciding when to trigger deep memory retrieval vs. remaining in a low-power idle state.

3. Whisper Agent (Gemini 3 Pro)
* Role: Natural Language Generation with high Emotional EQ.

* Output: Decides what to whisper to the patient to minimize cognitive load while maximizing social success (e.g., ""That's your grandson, Rahul. He was here yesterday."").

---

Safety & Monitoring (Weights & Biases)
We integrated **Weights & Biases (W&B) to move beyond a simple prototype into a safety-first HealthTech solution:

* Memory Confidence: Tracks how accurately the AI is identifying entities.
* Hallucination Guardrails: Logs AI reasoning paths to ensure whispers are grounded in the patient's actual history.
* Emotional Heatmaps: Provides caregivers with a dashboard of the patient's mood and engagement trends throughout the day.

---

Tech Stack
* Core AI: Google Gemini 3.0 Pro & Flash (Multimodal Preview).

* Observability: Weights & Biases (Trace & Dashboarding).
* Frontend: Vite, React (Glassmorphism & High-Contrast UI for accessibility).
* Backend: Python 3.10+, FastAPI.
* Deployment: Optimized for low-latency edge processing.

It creates a transparent and efficient three-node network that connects Citizens, Municipal Officials, and Field Supervisors, ensuring accountability and engagement at every step and also maintain a trust between government and citizen.

The platform is built on a ""three-faced"" model, providing a tailored experience for each user role:
1. For Citizens: An interactive, gamified mobile-first experience to report issues, track their resolution in real-time, and earn rewards for contributing to their community.
2. For Municipal Officials: A powerful administrative dashboard to manage incoming reports, assign tasks to field staff or supervisors, and monitor overall performance with detailed analytics.
3. For Field Supervisors: A streamlined work queue to receive assignments, submit completion reports with photo evidence, and compete on a performance-based leaderboard.

The application follows a seamless workflow powered by AI:

1. AI-Assisted Reporting (Citizen): A citizen spots an issue (e.g., a pothole). They use the app to capture photos, record audio notes, and select a category. Our AI engine, powered by Google's Gemini model, instantly analyses the submission to:
o Validate the image's relevance (whether the image actually represent a issue or not) and assign a severity score (1-10). If the image is of any random person or object it will be rejected during submission and no issue will be generated.
o Transcribe audio notes (can be in any language including regional languages like Hindi, Bengali etc.) into text.
o Checks whether the audio is relevant to the image or not.
o Determine an intelligent priority level (Low, Medium, High).
o Generate a concise, descriptive title with a ticket ID.

2. Sorting and Assignment (Municipal Official): The validated report appears in the official's ""Sorted Work Queue."" They can view all AI-generated details, see how many other citizens have ""joined"" the report, and assign it to the appropriate supervisor with a deadline.

3. Resolution and Verification (Field Supervisor): The ticket appears in the supervisor's personal dashboard. After completing the work, they submit a completion report with ""after"" photos. To ensure authenticity, our AI performs:
o AI Image Detection: Rejects submissions with AI-generated images and penalizes the supervisor's ""Trust Score.""
o Completion Analysis: Cross-validates the ""before"" and ""after"" photos to confirm the work was done correctly.

4. Final Approval & Feedback (Official & Citizen): The official reviews the supervisor's report, aided by the AI analysis. Upon approval, the ticket is marked as ""Resolved,"" and the supervisor earns ""Efficiency Points."" The original reporter i.e., the citizen is then notified and can provide a star rating, which directly influences the supervisor's ""Trust Score.""
Highlighting Features:
o Gamification Engine: In addition to simple reporting, CivicPulse also provides a rewarding and competitive environment where:
o Citizens earn Utility Points for valid reports, which can be redeemed for local vouchers (integration with Blockchain currency in future), and unlock Badges for achievements.
o Supervisors earn Efficiency Points for timely, high-quality work, competing on a dedicated leaderboard.
o A universal Trust Score penalizes misuse (e.g., spam reports, fraudulent photos) to maintain system integrity.
o Hybrid AI Priority Engine: Our intelligent triage system combines multiple data points—image severity, textual keywords, issue category, and community ""join"" count—to create a priority level that is far more accurate and effective than manual sorting as here priority will increase based on the number of users that joined the issue.","https://github.com/AmitavaDatta2004/Civic-Nexus , https://civic-pulse-seven.vercel.app/",https://youtu.be/AZlao4by4-c?si=bsuGyYa4IUe3hOZ_,2nd google track

Null Pointer,Puskar Nath,Souvik Chakraborty,,Rakshak, An intelligent AI guardian for nuclear plants that predicts disasters before they happen and guides operators with step-by-step instructions to save lives.,"Team Name: Null Pointer
RAKSHAK: An AI System for Proactive Nuclear Safety and Automated Emergency Coordination

1. Problem Statement
The privatization and growth of the nuclear ecosystem present a significant safety concern as India pursues its clean energy aspirations under the new SHANTI ACT.
Historical disasters like Bhopal and Chernobyl taught us a brutal lesson: the greatest loss of life isn't caused by the mechanical failure itself, but by the delay in detection and poor coordination between plant operators and external emergency services.
Current SCADA(Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems are Reactive—they trigger alarms only after a threshold is exceeded. In a critical meltdown scenario, this leaves minimal reaction time for operators and surrounding communities.
2. The Solution: RAKSHAK
RAKSHAK is an intelligent Human-Machine Interface (HMI) that transforms passive sensor data into proactive life-saving interventions .It's ""Physics-Constrained"" architecture guarantees that AI forecasts never go beyond safety rules or physical principles.
Key Concepts of the RAKSHAK Architecture
1. Analytics Layers (Deterministic & Machine Learning)
We split the AI analysis into two distinct parts:
•	Deterministic Safety Layer: This follows strict laws of physics. It uses Rate-of-Change Analysis ($dT/dt$ and $dP/dt$) to calculate the ""velocity of danger,"" helping us understand how fast the situation is escalating.
•	Machine-Learning Anomaly Layer: This uses advanced models  to detect tiny patterns or deviations in sensor data that are invisible to the human eye.
2. Rule-Based Safety  
This is a critical safety feature. This ensures the AI never violates reactor physics or regulatory limits. 
3. Probabilistic Root-Cause Diagnosis
The system doesn’t just say ""Danger""; it explains why it is happening using statistical confidence. For example: ""Primary Coolant Pump Failure: 85% Confidence."" This helps operators make the right decision instantly.
4. Dynamic SOP Guidance:
The system offers a particular SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) or Advisory Action Plan during a crisis. Based on the particular failure found, it provides the operator with detailed guidance on what to do next.
5. Defense-in-Depth & Security:
To satisfy regulatory bodies, the architecture includes Air-Gapped Data Access and Defense-in-Depth layers. This means the core safety logic is physically isolated from the internet to prevent cyber-attacks.
6.Safety Alert :
If the system detects a situation going out of control, it automatically sends alerts to nearby hospitals and police stations located outside the danger zone. This ensures help is ready before the crisis hits.
CONCLUSION:
Constrained AI framework to change nuclear safety from a reactive battle to a proactive approach. It prevents AI faults in critical  which guarantees complete dependability and regulatory compliance. In the end, RAKSHAK bridges the gap between detection and reaction to save lives by automating coordination with emergency services.",https://geminiworkflow.vercel.app/,https://youtu.be/Xyhirj5W_eE,

The Problem We’re Solving

Most people have had the experience of the problem called ""registration wall"" — that moment when you want to join an event but lose interest because you have to type out a long list of personal details. On top of that, scrolling through hundreds of events to find something that you actually want to be a part of or somewhere you actually want to be in.
To bridge this problem between organizers and attendees, we introduce “EventHub” ,making the entire problem less time-consuming and effortless rather than being a headache.


Our Proposed Solution

        EventHub, an AI-driven platform which handles the “heavy-lifting” for both the user and the administrator. Instead of a static website where everything feels dull, we built a living system which has a soul as AI that recognizes who you are and where you actually belong.
        Our core idea is simple: Handle the boring tasks, like typing forms and searching for an event for yourself, over to an AI, so we can focus on the event by our own.


How We Integrated Gemini 3 Pro

For this particular task we chose the model “Gemini 3 Pro Preview” because of its “multimodal features”, meaning it can understand images and texts simultaneously with human-like reasoning. 

A. AI-Powered Smart Registration
Instead of a manual form, we implemented a ""Scan & Go"" feature.
•        The Experience: A user simply uploads a photo of their ID card (which can be their college ID or any kind of Govt. ID).
•        The Intelligence: Gemini 3 Pro uses its vision capabilities to identify the layout of the card, extract the name and email, and even calculate the user's age based on their date of birth.
•        The Result: A registration process that used to take minutes now takes seconds, with zero typing required.
B. Contextual Event Recommendations
Most systems suggest events based on simple tags (e.g., ""Coding""). EventHub uses Gemini’s reasoning to understand the vibe of a user's interests and picks what matches their vibe perfectly.
•        The Experience: Users see a ""Top Picks"" section curated specifically for them.
•        The Intelligence: Gemini looks at a user’s profile and explains its logic. For example: ""Because you are a Computer Science student and recently attended a Logic Seminar, you might enjoy this Chess Tournament"".
•        The Result: Higher engagement because users feel the platform truly understands their professional and personal goals and tries to pick the best for the user.
C. Dynamic Access Control
We leveraged AI to help manage our secure 3-tier system (User, Moderator, Admin).
•        The Experience: Admins can ""invite"" others to help manage the site.
•        The Intelligence: The system uses secure back-end logic to generate invite notifications. Once a user accepts, the AI-driven ""Gatekeeper"" reveals their access credentials, ensuring that staff privileges are handled with high security but a smooth user flow.


Why This Matters

By using Gemini 3 Pro, we’ve moved beyond basic automation. We’ve created a platform that:
1.        Respects User Time: By eliminating manual data entry.
2.        Reduces Human Error: By letting AI handle data extraction from documents.
3.        Encourages Discovery: By making personalized suggestions that actually make sense to the user.
EventHub is not just a tool for booking events; it is a demonstration of how AI can make digital interactions feel more human.


Conclusion

        EventHub redefines the whole process of event managing by replacing the manual administrative hurdles with a seamless AI-driven experience. We have transformed the standard booking process into a modern digital concierge by prioritizing user time and personalization.
        The integration of “Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview” was a huge turn for this field, which took event managing to a next level. Its multimodal capabilities turned the complex task of ID verification into a “one-click” auto-fill action, while its reasoning engine allowed for sematic event recommendations that truly matches the vibes of the user.
        And last but not the least, this project stands out to be a proof that Generative AI can be powerful when it acts as an “invisible” layer, removing friction, enhancing security, and simplifying discovery. By combining the MERN Stack with cutting-edge AI, EventHub demonstrates that modern software can be both highly functional and genuinely human-centric.

Alu Siddo,Samiran Pal,Sudipta Ghorami,Aniket Pal,Context: Your Second Brain,"A browser extension that captures webpage context, stores it as searchable AI memory, and powers a smart chatbot using Gemini embeddings.","Context - Your Personal Second Brain for Web Browsing

Ever saved a hundred bookmarks and then forgot why you saved half of them? Yeah, we've all been there. That's exactly why we built Context.

What is it?

Context is a browser extension + web app combo that helps you save the important parts of web pages (not the whole page) and then lets you chat with your saved stuff using AI. Think of it like having a personal assistant who remembers everything you told them to remember.

The Problem We're Solving

Here's the thing - bookmarks are broken. You save a page, it sits in a folder, and three weeks later you have no idea why you saved it. The title says ""React Documentation"" but which part? What were you trying to learn?

We wanted something smarter:

Save only the parts that matter to you (a paragraph, a code snippet, a key insight)
Automatically tag and categorize what you save
Search by meaning, not just keywords
Ask questions and get answers from YOUR saved knowledge
How It Actually Works

Saving Memories (Ctrl+Shift+S)

When you're on any webpage and find something useful, just hit the keyboard shortcut. The extension grabs the page info - title, URL, any text you've selected. Then our AI (Gemini) analyzes it and creates a summary, figures out why you might have saved it (learning? research? shopping?), and adds relevant tags. Everything gets stored with vector embeddings so we can search by meaning later.

The Chat Feature (RAG Pipeline)

This is the cool part. When you ask a question like ""What did I read about React hooks?"", here's what happens behind the scenes:

Your question gets converted into a vector (numbers that represent meaning)
We search through all your saved memories to find the most relevant ones
We bundle those memories as context and ask the AI to answer using ONLY your saved content
You get an answer with sources showing exactly which memories were used
It's called RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - basically the AI only knows what you've told it to remember.

Dashboard & Stats

See all your memories in one place. Filter by intent (learning, research, work, etc.), search semantically, view tag clouds, check how many memories you have per category. It's your personal knowledge base visualized.

Tech Stack

Browser Extension - Chrome extension with React-based sidepanel, captures page content
Backend - Node.js + Express, handles auth, memory storage, search, and chat
Database - MongoDB for storing memories with vector embeddings
AI - Google Gemini for content analysis, summarization, embeddings, and chat responses
Frontend Web App - React + TypeScript dashboard for viewing memories and chatting
Features

One-click save - Ctrl+Shift+S saves current page with AI analysis
Smart summarization - AI creates a 1-2 sentence summary of what you saved
Auto-tagging - Automatically adds 3-5 relevant tags
Intent detection - Figures out if you're learning, researching, shopping, etc.
Semantic search - Search by meaning, not just exact words
RAG Chat - Ask questions, get answers from your saved memories
Source citations - See which memories the AI used to answer
Privacy-first - Nothing is saved unless YOU choose to save it
What Makes This Different

Most note-taking or bookmark apps either:

Save too much (whole pages you'll never read again)
Require too much manual work (tagging, organizing)
Don't let you query your knowledge
We hit a middle ground - you control what gets saved, but the AI does the boring work of organizing and retrieving. And when you need that info back, you just ask in plain English.

Privacy

We take this seriously. The extension doesn't auto-save anything. No background scraping. No selling your data. You press save, it saves. You don't press save, it doesn't exist in our system. Simple.",https://github.com/samiranpal2004/Context,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8B8mw-tik,

It allows CEOs to simulate high-stakes decisions, predict specific competitor counter-moves, and generate execution blueprints—war-gaming the future before spending a dollar.

💡 The Problem (Business/FinTech track):
Strategic decision-making is currently broken. Executives rely on gut instinct or static spreadsheets to make billion-dollar bets.
The Cost: 67% of strategic plans fail due to unforeseen second-order effects.
The Gap: There is no tool that simulates ""Competitor Retaliation."" Standard AI gives generic advice; it doesn't play out the scenario like a chess engine.

🛠️ The Solution :
StratOS upgrades the concept of a ""Chatbot"" to a ""Simulation Engine.""
By leveraging Gemini’s advanced reasoning and massive context window, we created a Nash Equilibrium Engine.
Twin Synchronization: Ingests company profile and market context.

CropShield is a multilingual, multimodal AI platform that acts as a ""Digital Kissan Mitra"" (Farmer's Friend), bridging the gap between frontier AI and the furrowed field.

How we built it (The Tech Stack):

Multimodal Reasoning (Gemini 2.5 Flash): We go beyond simple image classification. CropShield combines Visual Evidence (leaf photo) + Environmental Context (Real-time Lat/Long Weather Data). The model reasons across these modalities—for example, advising against chemical spraying if rain is forecast—to generate a safe, hyper-local treatment plan.

Native Audio Agent (The Breakthrough): Leveraging Gemini 2.5’s native audio streaming, we built a real-time, bi-directional voice agent. It bypasses text entirely. Farmers can speak in their local dialect (Hindi/Bengali), and the AI listens, understands context, and responds instantly with empathy and precision.

Key Features:
Zero-Literacy Interface: Full functionality via Native Audio.
Dual-Path Remedy: Suggests both zero-cost organic solutions (""Desi Jugad"") and specific chemical brands available in local markets.
Market Linkage: Locates nearby fertilizer shops using Geolocation.

In future we will add a crop related disease catalog that works based on the crop's age ( growth stage). These feature will help farmers identify possible diseases before and after they affect the crop.

The Orchestrator: The brain of the system that receives teacher inputs and coordinates specialized sub-agents.

The Personalization Agent: Analyzes student profiles (interests, learning gaps, and past scores) to generate three distinct versions of every lesson: Emerging, Proficient, and Advanced.

The Smart Classroom Agent: Recommends specific EdTech tool integrations (VR, IoT, or interactive boards) tailored to the day's specific activity.

Socratic Feedback Engine: An interactive layer that engages students with critical-thinking questions rather than rote memorization, facilitating true conceptual understanding.

3. Key Features
Real-time Differentiation: Automatically adjusts reading levels, vocabulary, and problem complexity based on individual student data.

Interests-Based Scaffolding: Can re-frame complex math or science problems into contexts students care about (e.g., using sports stats to teach linear equations).

Interactive Chat Interface: A student-facing portal where the AI acts as a 1:1 tutor, using the Socratic method to guide them toward answers.

Teacher Dashboard: Provides a birds-eye view of classroom progress, highlighting which students are ""stuck"" and requiring human intervention.

4. The Value Proposition
For Teachers: Reduces the administrative burden of manual differentiation by up to 80%, allowing educators to focus on emotional support and high-level mentorship.

For Students: Provides a ""safe space"" to ask questions and receive explanations that resonate with their personal learning style.

For Schools: Maximizes the utility of existing hardware (tablets, smartboards) by providing a software layer that makes these tools truly ""smart.""

Qumtum Crew,Somya Ranjan Bhoi,Ayan Ghosh,Ankan Ghosh,Study-with-me,StudyWithMe helps students truly understand concepts by adapting explanations to their learning depth while maintaining academic integrity in assignments.,"StudyWithMe is an ethical, depth-driven AI learning platform designed to act like a real teacher, tutor, and learning companion for students. Instead of simply giving answers, it focuses on helping students understand concepts at their own level, practice what they learn, and receive guidance on assignments without breaking academic integrity.

Most existing AI tools provide the same explanation to everyone and often give direct solutions, which leads to memorization and copying rather than real learning. StudyWithMe solves this problem by allowing students to choose how deeply they want to learn and by strictly separating learning support from answer generation.

The platform offers three learning depth levels:

Core – For beginners who need simple explanations, intuition, and fundamentals

Applied – For students who want step-by-step reasoning and practice

Mastery – For advanced learners who want deeper logic, assumptions, and edge cases

Based on the selected depth, StudyWithMe adapts how much explanation, reasoning, and detail it provides.

StudyWithMe also supports two modes of interaction:

Interactive Learning Mode
In this mode, the AI teaches concepts step by step, using examples and explanations that match the student’s depth level. It explains mathematics using equations, programming using code, and science using formulas—so students learn in the natural language of the subject, not just English text.

Assignment Help Mode (Ethical by Design)
In this mode, the AI never gives direct answers or fully solved code. Instead, it provides hints, breaks down the problem, explains the underlying concepts, and asks guiding questions. This ensures students learn while solving, rather than copying answers.

A key strength of StudyWithMe is its Ethics Guard, a rule-based system that prevents cheating and enforces responsible AI behavior. This makes the platform safe for real academic environments such as schools, colleges, and institutions.

Technically, StudyWithMe uses a Node.js backend to control all AI behavior and enforce rules, and a Next.js frontend to provide a clean, student-friendly interface. The AI model is used as a constrained reasoning engine, meaning it follows strict system instructions and does not decide learning depth or ethics on its own.

In summary, StudyWithMe is not an answer generator.
It is a depth-aware, ethical learning companion built to help students grow academically by understanding concepts properly, practicing independently, and solving assignments the right way.",https://github.com/ankan288/Studywithme.git,https://youtu.be/_1ShRqCXi70,

Team PMPN,Prinjal Mistry,Priyam Naskar,,Vibe Check AI,Checks up your vibe and fashion and makes your looks better with AI,"Vibe Check AI is an intelligent fashion assistant designed to help users choose the right clothing size and style with confidence while shopping online. Many people hesitate to buy clothes online because they are unsure how an outfit will actually fit their body. This project addresses that problem by combining video input and artificial intelligence to provide personalized fashion advice.

The user simply uploads a short full-body walking video and pastes the link of a dress or outfit they want to buy from platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, or Myntra. The system then uses an AI stylist powered by Google Gemini to analyze the product details and generate a detailed fit recommendation. It evaluates fabric quality, predicts how different sizes (XS to XXL) may fit, assigns a fit score, recommends the best size, and suggests similar outfits suitable for the user’s body type. A price comparison in Indian Rupees is also provided for better decision-making.

The application is built using Streamlit for a clean, mobile-friendly interface and focuses on clarity and usability rather than complexity. While the current version uses simulated body analysis, it is designed to support real-time posture, height, and body shape detection in future versions. Vibe Check AI demonstrates how AI can enhance online shopping by making fashion advice more personalized, practical, and accessible.",https://github.com/PRIME-BN1000/ML_hackathon,https://youtu.be/Mg6ENrZCTNA?si=9cJKULYDyaG4EDGV,
