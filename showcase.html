    "Title": "Mnemosyne - The AI Memory Prosthetic",
    "Subtitle": "Instead of a simple reminder app, Mnemosyne is an \"Always-On\" Multi-Agent System that runs on an early-stage Alzheimer’s/Dementia patients' phone (or wearable) and passively \"listens\" to conversations and \"sees\" the environment (via camera/audio) to provide real-time context cues to the patient before they get confused.",
    "Project Description": "We've added a detailed description about the entire project in this public README: https://github.com/shagil77/mnemosyne\n\nMnemosyne: The Gemini 3 Memory Prosthetic 🧠✨\n\nA real-time \"Cognitive Prosthetic\" that leverages Gemini 3's 2M+ context window to restore dignity and social connection for dementia patients.\n\n---\n\nThe Mission (Problem & Impact): Dementia doesn't just steal memories; it steals the confidence to interact with the world. Patients often face the \"Stranger in the Mirror\" problem—failing to recognize loved ones, which leads to social withdrawal and rapid cognitive decline. Mnemosyne acts as an invisible, empathetic friend that whispers vital context (names, shared memories, and emotional cues) into a patient’s earpiece in real-time, allowing them to navigate life with independence and dignity.\n\n---\n\nTechnical Architecture: Mnemosyne uses a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System designed to process a live multimodal stream with extreme efficiency.\n\n1. Perception Agent (Gemini 3 Flash)\n\n* Role: Handles the high-frequency multimodal \"Passive Listening\" phase.\n\n* Capability: Processes sub-second video/audio frames to detect faces, voices, and environmental \"vibes.\" It outputs structured JSON only when \"High-Signal\" entities (like a person entering the room) are detected.\n\n2. Context Agent (Gemini 3 Pro)\n* Role: The \"Active Reasoning\" brain.\n\n* Gemini Advantage: Utilizes the 2M+ context window to maintain a \"Living Knowledge Graph\" of the patient’s entire life history.\n* Frugal Relevance Filter: We engineered a custom filter that reduces token usage by intelligently deciding when to trigger deep memory retrieval vs. remaining in a low-power idle state.\n\n3. Whisper Agent (Gemini 3 Pro)\n* Role: Natural Language Generation with high Emotional EQ.\n\n* Output: Decides what to whisper to the patient to minimize cognitive load while maximizing social success (e.g., \"That's your grandson, Rahul. He was here yesterday.\").\n\n---\n\nSafety & Monitoring (Weights & Biases)\nWe integrated **Weights & Biases (W&B) to move beyond a simple prototype into a safety-first HealthTech solution:\n\n* Memory Confidence: Tracks how accurately the AI is identifying entities.\n* Hallucination Guardrails: Logs AI reasoning paths to ensure whispers are grounded in the patient's actual history.\n* Emotional Heatmaps: Provides caregivers with a dashboard of the patient's mood and engagement trends throughout the day.\n\n---\n\nTech Stack\n* Core AI: Google Gemini 3.0 Pro & Flash (Multimodal Preview).\n\n* Observability: Weights & Biases (Trace & Dashboarding).\n* Frontend: Vite, React (Glassmorphism & High-Contrast UI for accessibility).\n* Backend: Python 3.10+, FastAPI.\n* Deployment: Optimized for low-latency edge processing.\n\n---\n\nMnemosyne doesn't just use AI to answer questions; it uses Gemini 3 to anticipate human needs. By bridging global knowledge (recognizing a face) with private memory (mapping that face to a grandson), we’ve created a \"Zero-UI\" interface where the technology learns the patient, not the other way around.\n\nSubmission for the Global GenAI Hackathon hosted by Machine Learning Kolkata.",

    "Subtitle": "CivicPulse reconnects citizens with their local government by transforming the often frustrating process of reporting public issues into a simple, transparent, and rewarding collaboration, using AI to help everyone work together to build safer and more beautiful communities.",
    "Project Description": "CivicPulse is a comprehensive, AI-powered Progressive Web App (PWA) with TWA features designed to revolutionize how local communities report, manage, and resolve civic issues. It creates a transparent and efficient three-node network that connects Citizens, Municipal Officials, and Field Supervisors, ensuring accountability and engagement at every step and also maintain a trust between government and citizen.\n\nThe platform is built on a \"three-faced\" model, providing a tailored experience for each user role:\n1. For Citizens: An interactive, gamified mobile-first experience to report issues, track their resolution in real-time, and earn rewards for contributing to their community.\n2. For Municipal Officials: A powerful administrative dashboard to manage incoming reports, assign tasks to field staff or supervisors, and monitor overall performance with detailed analytics.\n3. For Field Supervisors: A streamlined work queue to receive assignments, submit completion reports with photo evidence, and compete on a performance-based leaderboard.\n\nThe application follows a seamless workflow powered by AI:\n\n1. AI-Assisted Reporting (Citizen): A citizen spots an issue (e.g., a pothole). They use the app to capture photos, record audio notes, and select a category. Our AI engine, powered by Google's Gemini model, instantly analyses the submission to:\no Validate the image's relevance (whether the image actually represent a issue or not) and assign a severity score (1-10). If the image is of any random person or object it will be rejected during submission and no issue will be generated.\no Transcribe audio notes (can be in any language including regional languages like Hindi, Bengali etc.) into text.\no Checks whether the audio is relevant to the image or not.\no Determine an intelligent priority level (Low, Medium, High).\no Generate a concise, descriptive title with a ticket ID.\n\n2. Sorting and Assignment (Municipal Official): The validated report appears in the official's \"Sorted Work Queue.\" They can view all AI-generated details, see how many other citizens have \"joined\" the report, and assign it to the appropriate supervisor with a deadline.\n\n3. Resolution and Verification (Field Supervisor): The ticket appears in the supervisor's personal dashboard. After completing the work, they submit a completion report with \"after\" photos. To ensure authenticity, our AI performs:\no AI Image Detection: Rejects submissions with AI-generated images and penalizes the supervisor's \"Trust Score.\"\no Completion Analysis: Cross-validates the \"before\" and \"after\" photos to confirm the work was done correctly.\n\n4. Final Approval & Feedback (Official & Citizen): The official reviews the supervisor's report, aided by the AI analysis. Upon approval, the ticket is marked as \"Resolved,\" and the supervisor earns \"Efficiency Points.\" The original reporter i.e., the citizen is then notified and can provide a star rating, which directly influences the supervisor's \"Trust Score.\"\nHighlighting Features:\no Gamification Engine: In addition to simple reporting, CivicPulse also provides a rewarding and competitive environment where:\no Citizens earn Utility Points for valid reports, which can be redeemed for local vouchers (integration with Blockchain currency in future), and unlock Badges for achievements.\no Supervisors earn Efficiency Points for timely, high-quality work, competing on a dedicated leaderboard.\no A universal Trust Score penalizes misuse (e.g., spam reports, fraudulent photos) to maintain system integrity.\no Hybrid AI Priority Engine: Our intelligent triage system combines multiple data points—image severity, textual keywords, issue category, and community \"join\" count—to create a priority level that is far more accurate and effective than manual sorting as here priority will increase based on the number of users that joined the issue.",

    "Project Description": "Team Name: Null Pointer\nRAKSHAK: An AI System for Proactive Nuclear Safety and Automated Emergency Coordination\n\n1. Problem Statement\nThe privatization and growth of the nuclear ecosystem present a significant safety concern as India pursues its clean energy aspirations under the new SHANTI ACT.\nHistorical disasters like Bhopal and Chernobyl taught us a brutal lesson: the greatest loss of life isn't caused by the mechanical failure itself, but by the delay in detection and poor coordination between plant operators and external emergency services.\nCurrent SCADA(Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems are Reactive—they trigger alarms only after a threshold is exceeded. In a critical meltdown scenario, this leaves minimal reaction time for operators and surrounding communities.\n2. The Solution: RAKSHAK\nRAKSHAK is an intelligent Human-Machine Interface (HMI) that transforms passive sensor data into proactive life-saving interventions .It's \"Physics-Constrained\" architecture guarantees that AI forecasts never go beyond safety rules or physical principles.\nKey Concepts of the RAKSHAK Architecture\n1. Analytics Layers (Deterministic & Machine Learning)\nWe split the AI analysis into two distinct parts:\n•\tDeterministic Safety Layer: This follows strict laws of physics. It uses Rate-of-Change Analysis ($dT/dt$ and $dP/dt$) to calculate the \"velocity of danger,\" helping us understand how fast the situation is escalating.\n•\tMachine-Learning Anomaly Layer: This uses advanced models  to detect tiny patterns or deviations in sensor data that are invisible to the human eye.\n2. Rule-Based Safety  \nThis is a critical safety feature. This ensures the AI never violates reactor physics or regulatory limits. \n3. Probabilistic Root-Cause Diagnosis\nThe system doesn’t just say \"Danger\"; it explains why it is happening using statistical confidence. For example: \"Primary Coolant Pump Failure: 85% Confidence.\" This helps operators make the right decision instantly.\n4. Dynamic SOP Guidance:\nThe system offers a particular SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) or Advisory Action Plan during a crisis. Based on the particular failure found, it provides the operator with detailed guidance on what to do next.\n5. Defense-in-Depth & Security:\nTo satisfy regulatory bodies, the architecture includes Air-Gapped Data Access and Defense-in-Depth layers. This means the core safety logic is physically isolated from the internet to prevent cyber-attacks.\n6.Safety Alert :\nIf the system detects a situation going out of control, it automatically sends alerts to nearby hospitals and police stations located outside the danger zone. This ensures help is ready before the crisis hits.\nCONCLUSION:\nConstrained AI framework to change nuclear safety from a reactive battle to a proactive approach. It prevents AI faults in critical  which guarantees complete dependability and regulatory compliance. In the end, RAKSHAK bridges the gap between detection and reaction to save lives by automating coordination with emergency services.",

    "Project Description": "EventHub – Event Engagement with Gemini 3 Pro\n\n\nThe Problem We’re Solving\n\nMost people have had the experience of the problem called \"registration wall\" — that moment when you want to join an event but lose interest because you have to type out a long list of personal details. On top of that, scrolling through hundreds of events to find something that you actually want to be a part of or somewhere you actually want to be in.\nTo bridge this problem between organizers and attendees, we introduce “EventHub” ,making the entire problem less time-consuming and effortless rather than being a headache.\n\n\nOur Proposed Solution\n\n        EventHub, an AI-driven platform which handles the “heavy-lifting” for both the user and the administrator. Instead of a static website where everything feels dull, we built a living system which has a soul as AI that recognizes who you are and where you actually belong.\n        Our core idea is simple: Handle the boring tasks, like typing forms and searching for an event for yourself, over to an AI, so we can focus on the event by our own.\n\n\nHow We Integrated Gemini 3 Pro\n\nFor this particular task we chose the model “Gemini 3 Pro Preview” because of its “multimodal features”, meaning it can understand images and texts simultaneously with human-like reasoning. \n\nA. AI-Powered Smart Registration\nInstead of a manual form, we implemented a \"Scan & Go\" feature.\n•        The Experience: A user simply uploads a photo of their ID card (which can be their college ID or any kind of Govt. ID).\n•        The Intelligence: Gemini 3 Pro uses its vision capabilities to identify the layout of the card, extract the name and email, and even calculate the user's age based on their date of birth.\n•        The Result: A registration process that used to take minutes now takes seconds, with zero typing required.\nB. Contextual Event Recommendations\nMost systems suggest events based on simple tags (e.g., \"Coding\"). EventHub uses Gemini’s reasoning to understand the vibe of a user's interests and picks what matches their vibe perfectly.\n•        The Experience: Users see a \"Top Picks\" section curated specifically for them.\n•        The Intelligence: Gemini looks at a user’s profile and explains its logic. For example: \"Because you are a Computer Science student and recently attended a Logic Seminar, you might enjoy this Chess Tournament\".\n•        The Result: Higher engagement because users feel the platform truly understands their professional and personal goals and tries to pick the best for the user.\nC. Dynamic Access Control\nWe leveraged AI to help manage our secure 3-tier system (User, Moderator, Admin).\n•        The Experience: Admins can \"invite\" others to help manage the site.\n•        The Intelligence: The system uses secure back-end logic to generate invite notifications. Once a user accepts, the AI-driven \"Gatekeeper\" reveals their access credentials, ensuring that staff privileges are handled with high security but a smooth user flow.\n\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nBy using Gemini 3 Pro, we’ve moved beyond basic automation. We’ve created a platform that:\n1.        Respects User Time: By eliminating manual data entry.\n2.        Reduces Human Error: By letting AI handle data extraction from documents.\n3.        Encourages Discovery: By making personalized suggestions that actually make sense to the user.\nEventHub is not just a tool for booking events; it is a demonstration of how AI can make digital interactions feel more human.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n        EventHub redefines the whole process of event managing by replacing the manual administrative hurdles with a seamless AI-driven experience. We have transformed the standard booking process into a modern digital concierge by prioritizing user time and personalization.\n        The integration of “Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview” was a huge turn for this field, which took event managing to a next level. Its multimodal capabilities turned the complex task of ID verification into a “one-click” auto-fill action, while its reasoning engine allowed for sematic event recommendations that truly matches the vibes of the user.\n        And last but not the least, this project stands out to be a proof that Generative AI can be powerful when it acts as an “invisible” layer, removing friction, enhancing security, and simplifying discovery. By combining the MERN Stack with cutting-edge AI, EventHub demonstrates that modern software can be both highly functional and genuinely human-centric.",

    "Project Description": "Context - Your Personal Second Brain for Web Browsing\n\nEver saved a hundred bookmarks and then forgot why you saved half of them? Yeah, we've all been there. That's exactly why we built Context.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nContext is a browser extension + web app combo that helps you save the important parts of web pages (not the whole page) and then lets you chat with your saved stuff using AI. Think of it like having a personal assistant who remembers everything you told them to remember.\n\nThe Problem We're Solving\n\nHere's the thing - bookmarks are broken. You save a page, it sits in a folder, and three weeks later you have no idea why you saved it. The title says \"React Documentation\" but which part? What were you trying to learn?\n\nWe wanted something smarter:\n\nSave only the parts that matter to you (a paragraph, a code snippet, a key insight)\nAutomatically tag and categorize what you save\nSearch by meaning, not just keywords\nAsk questions and get answers from YOUR saved knowledge\nHow It Actually Works\n\nSaving Memories (Ctrl+Shift+S)\n\nWhen you're on any webpage and find something useful, just hit the keyboard shortcut. The extension grabs the page info - title, URL, any text you've selected. Then our AI (Gemini) analyzes it and creates a summary, figures out why you might have saved it (learning? research? shopping?), and adds relevant tags. Everything gets stored with vector embeddings so we can search by meaning later.\n\nThe Chat Feature (RAG Pipeline)\n\nThis is the cool part. When you ask a question like \"What did I read about React hooks?\", here's what happens behind the scenes:\n\nYour question gets converted into a vector (numbers that represent meaning)\nWe search through all your saved memories to find the most relevant ones\nWe bundle those memories as context and ask the AI to answer using ONLY your saved content\nYou get an answer with sources showing exactly which memories were used\nIt's called RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - basically the AI only knows what you've told it to remember.\n\nDashboard & Stats\n\nSee all your memories in one place. Filter by intent (learning, research, work, etc.), search semantically, view tag clouds, check how many memories you have per category. It's your personal knowledge base visualized.\n\nTech Stack\n\nBrowser Extension - Chrome extension with React-based sidepanel, captures page content\nBackend - Node.js + Express, handles auth, memory storage, search, and chat\nDatabase - MongoDB for storing memories with vector embeddings\nAI - Google Gemini for content analysis, summarization, embeddings, and chat responses\nFrontend Web App - React + TypeScript dashboard for viewing memories and chatting\nFeatures\n\nOne-click save - Ctrl+Shift+S saves current page with AI analysis\nSmart summarization - AI creates a 1-2 sentence summary of what you saved\nAuto-tagging - Automatically adds 3-5 relevant tags\nIntent detection - Figures out if you're learning, researching, shopping, etc.\nSemantic search - Search by meaning, not just exact words\nRAG Chat - Ask questions, get answers from your saved memories\nSource citations - See which memories the AI used to answer\nPrivacy-first - Nothing is saved unless YOU choose to save it\nWhat Makes This Different\n\nMost note-taking or bookmark apps either:\n\nSave too much (whole pages you'll never read again)\nRequire too much manual work (tagging, organizing)\nDon't let you query your knowledge\nWe hit a middle ground - you control what gets saved, but the AI does the boring work of organizing and retrieving. And when you need that info back, you just ask in plain English.\n\nPrivacy\n\nWe take this seriously. The extension doesn't auto-save anything. No background scraping. No selling your data. You press save, it saves. You don't press save, it doesn't exist in our system. Simple.",

CropShield combines Visual Evidence (leaf photo) + Environmental Context (Real-time Lat/Long Weather Data). The model reasons across these modalities—for example, advising against chemical spraying if rain is forecast—to generate a safe, hyper-local treatment plan.\n\nNative Audio Agent (The Breakthrough): Leveraging Gemini 2.5’s native audio streaming, we built a real-time, bi-directional voice agent. It bypasses text entirely. Farmers can speak in their local dialect (Hindi/Bengali), and the AI listens, understands context, and responds instantly with empathy and precision.\n\nKey Features:\nZero-Literacy Interface: Full functionality via Native Audio.\nDual-Path Remedy: Suggests both zero-cost organic solutions (\"Desi Jugad\") and specific chemical brands available in local markets.\nMarket Linkage: Locates nearby fertilizer shops using Geolocation.\n\nIn future we will add a crop related disease catalog that works based on the crop's age ( growth stage).

Instead of sending the entire video to an AI model, only these key visual snapshots are selected. Each snapshot is then analyzed using a Generative AI vision model, which produces a short, clear summary explaining what is happening at that exact moment in the lecture.\n\nThe final output is a structured timeline containing timestamps, visual snapshots, and concise summaries. This allows learners to quickly scan the lecture, understand what topics are covered, and jump directly to the parts they need for revision.

Project Overview\nNEXUS AI AGENT is an intelligent, multi-agent orchestration platform designed to transform traditional classrooms into dynamic, personalized learning environments. Built using advanced LLMs (like Gemini) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Nexus acts as a \"Digital Teaching Assistant\" that analyzes student performance in real-time to curate bespoke educational paths.\n\nThe core of Nexus lies in its ability to take a single lesson topic and automatically differentiate it into scaffolded tiers, ensuring that no student is left behind while high-performers remain challenged.\n\n2. What We Built\nWe developed a fully functional agentic workflow that handles the heavy lifting of lesson planning and student monitoring:\n\nThe Orchestrator: The brain of the system that receives teacher inputs and coordinates specialized sub-agents.\n\nThe Personalization Agent: Analyzes student profiles (interests, learning gaps, and past scores) to generate three distinct versions of every lesson: Emerging, Proficient, and Advanced.\n\nThe Smart Classroom Agent: Recommends specific EdTech tool integrations (VR, IoT, or interactive boards) tailored to the day's specific activity.\n\nSocratic Feedback Engine: An interactive layer that engages students with critical-thinking questions rather than rote memorization, facilitating true conceptual understanding.\n\n3. Key Features\nReal-time Differentiation: Automatically adjusts reading levels, vocabulary, and problem complexity based on individual student data.\n\nInterests-Based Scaffolding: Can re-frame complex math or science problems into contexts students care about (e.g., using sports stats to teach linear equations).\n\nInteractive Chat Interface: A student-facing portal where the AI acts as a 1:1 tutor, using the Socratic method to guide them toward answers.\n\nTeacher Dashboard: Provides a birds-eye view of classroom progress, highlighting which students are \"stuck\" and requiring human intervention.\n\n4. The Value Proposition\nFor Teachers: Reduces the administrative burden of manual differentiation by up to 80%, allowing educators to focus on emotional support and high-level mentorship.\n\nFor Students: Provides a \"safe space\" to ask questions and receive explanations that resonate with their personal learning style.\n\nFor Schools: Maximizes the utility of existing hardware (tablets, smartboards) by providing a software layer that makes these tools truly \"smart.\"\n\n5. Technical Stack\nAI Engine: Google Gemini Pro / Flash (via Google AI Studio/Vertex AI).\n\nFramework: Python / LangChain (or CrewAI/Autogen for agent orchestration).\n\nDeployment: Vercel (Frontend) & FastAPI (Backend).\n\nInterfacing: Streamlit / Next.js for the user dashboard.",

    "Project Description": "StudyWithMe is an ethical, depth-driven AI learning platform designed to act like a real teacher, tutor, and learning companion for students. Instead of simply giving answers, it focuses on helping students understand concepts at their own level, practice what they learn, and receive guidance on assignments without breaking academic integrity.\n\nMost existing AI tools provide the same explanation to everyone and often give direct solutions, which leads to memorization and copying rather than real learning. StudyWithMe solves this problem by allowing students to choose how deeply they want to learn and by strictly separating learning support from answer generation.\n\nThe platform offers three learning depth levels:\n\nCore – For beginners who need simple explanations, intuition, and fundamentals\n\nApplied – For students who want step-by-step reasoning and practice\n\nMastery – For advanced learners who want deeper logic, assumptions, and edge cases\n\nBased on the selected depth, StudyWithMe adapts how much explanation, reasoning, and detail it provides.\n\nStudyWithMe also supports two modes of interaction:\n\nInteractive Learning Mode\nIn this mode, the AI teaches concepts step by step, using examples and explanations that match the student’s depth level. It explains mathematics using equations, programming using code, and science using formulas—so students learn in the natural language of the subject, not just English text.\n\nAssignment Help Mode (Ethical by Design)\nIn this mode, the AI never gives direct answers or fully solved code. Instead, it provides hints, breaks down the problem, explains the underlying concepts, and asks guiding questions. This ensures students learn while solving, rather than copying answers.\n\nA key strength of StudyWithMe is its Ethics Guard, a rule-based system that prevents cheating and enforces responsible AI behavior. This makes the platform safe for real academic environments such as schools, colleges, and institutions.\n\nTechnically, StudyWithMe uses a Node.js backend to control all AI behavior and enforce rules, and a Next.js frontend to provide a clean, student-friendly interface. The AI model is used as a constrained reasoning engine, meaning it follows strict system instructions and does not decide learning depth or ethics on its own.\n\nIn summary, StudyWithMe is not an answer generator.\nIt is a depth-aware, ethical learning companion built to help students grow academically by understanding concepts properly, practicing independently, and solving assignments the right way.",

Many people hesitate to buy clothes online because they are unsure how an outfit will actually fit their body. This project addresses that problem by combining video input and artificial intelligence to provide personalized fashion advice.\n\nThe user simply uploads a short full-body walking video and pastes the link of a dress or outfit they want to buy from platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, or Myntra. The system then uses an AI stylist powered by Google Gemini to analyze the product details and generate a detailed fit recommendation. It evaluates fabric quality, predicts how different sizes (XS to XXL) may fit, assigns a fit score, recommends the best size, and suggests similar outfits suitable for the user’s body type. A price comparison in Indian Rupees is also provided for better decision-making.\n\nThe application is built using Streamlit for a clean, mobile-friendly interface and focuses on clarity and usability rather than complexity. While the current version uses simulated body analysis, it is designed to support real-time posture, height, and body shape detection in future versions. Vibe Check AI demonstrates how AI can enhance online shopping by making fashion advice more personalized, practical, and accessible.",

These signals are fused into a priority score that feeds a Fibonacci-heap–based decision scheduler.\n\nEach possible action (such as responding supportively or remaining silent) is treated as a schedulable decision with an explicit priority. Only after a decision is selected does the system optionally invoke a language model, making the LLM a tool rather than the agent’s reasoning core.\n\nThis architecture demonstrates how agent behavior can be governed by internal cognition and intentional control, enabling restraint, transparency, and extensibility beyond prompt-based chatbots.",
